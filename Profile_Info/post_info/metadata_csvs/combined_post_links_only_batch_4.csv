3. Mix in the miso or salt. Add the marshmallows and stir with a rubber spatula until they melt together into a big fluff. Turn off the heat and mix in the cereal, a cup at a time. You want the marshmallows to coat all of the cereal fully.

Pan-fry mushed salted duck egg yolk with about 1 tablespoon unsalted butter over medium heat until foamy, about 1 to 2 minutes, then stir in the cornflakes and cook until toasty and crispier, about 2 minutes. 3. Spread filling – like peanut butter or kaya jam, over a slice of bread, or over two slices if you’re using three slices. 4. Sandwich together, dip into egg wash, then press the cereal into the soaked bread. 5. Pan-fry all sides in about 1 tablespoon of melted unsalted butter until golden brown and crispy, for about 1 to 2 minutes on each flat side over medium heat. 6. Drizzle sweetened condensed milk, and top with a slice or cube of unsalted butter! Enjoy!"". "

If you can’t find a Ditto in the wild to transform into ube cake, check out the best chiffon cake recipe on page 87 of my cookbook, Modern Asian Baking at Home. You can also try this recipe.

INGREDIENTS
Oil, butter, or nonstick spray, for greasing 

For the yolk batter:
4 large egg yolks
1 cup cake flour
2 tablespoons sugar
½ teaspoon baking powder
A pinch of salt or miso
½ cup sparkling water
1 tablespoon Greek yogurt
1 teaspoon-1 tablespoon ube extract (for purple color and ube flavor)

For the egg white batter:
4 large egg whites
¼ teaspoon cream of tartar or ½ teaspoon lemon juice (for stabilization)
½ cup powdered sugar

PREPARATION
1. Grease the rice cooker bowl with oil, butter, or nonstick spray.
2. To make the yolk batter, mix all the yolk batter ingredients in a medium bowl until smooth.
3. To make the egg white batter, in a separate bowl, whip the egg whites with the cream of tartar or lemon juice until soft peaks form. Gradually add the powdered sugar and continue whipping until stiff peaks form. You can use a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment or hand mixer. 
4. Gently fold the egg whites into the yolk batter using a rubber spatula, being careful to not deflate the mixture. Fold until no white streaks remain.
5. Gently pour the cake batter into the prepared bowl, smoothing the top without deflating the mixture.
6. To cook in a rice cooker, set the rice cooker to “Mixed Mode” first. Once that cycle is complete, set it to “Hard Mode.” If the cake is still not done, run it once more on “Quick Mode.” If your rice cooker does not have all these modes, try cooking the cake on 1½ cycles to start.

Ingredients:

For the frosting:
One 8-ounce bar of cream cheese, softened
1/3 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 to 2 tablespoons heavy cream, and more as needed
1 tablespoon miso
Pinch of kosher salt
2/3 to 1 cup confectioners’ sugar

For the cookie:
Use your favorite sugar cookie dough, enough to make 27 to 28 cookies
1/3 cup freeze-dried strawberries, crushed
1 cup white chocolate chips
1/4 cup chopped macadamia nuts

To make the cookies, portion dough into 1 tablespoon-sized balls on a baking sheet with parchment paper and chill for 30 minutes in the fridge. Flatten cookie balls and bake at 350°F until the edges are golden brown, about 12 minutes.

To make the cheesecake frosting, whisk all the ingredients together until smooth and spreadable. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with the piping tip of your choice. I chose a round tip here.
